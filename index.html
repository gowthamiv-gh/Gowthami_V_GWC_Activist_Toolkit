    <h2>Exercise Regularly!</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Why you should exercise regularly:</h4>
      <br>
    <p>Exercising regularly results in Better Mental Health, Improved Physical Health and Longevity.</p>
  
      <br>     

      <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <br>
      <h4>Here are some common misconceptions associated with exercise:</h4>
        <br>
      <p>→ "I was fit once, so I do not need to exercise". Unfortunately this is not true. Consistency is key.</p>
        <br>
      <p>→ "I'm too old to exercise". This is not true. Evidence shows that aging alone is not a cause for major problems until you're in the mid 90s.</p>
        <br>
      <p>→ "I run once a week, but that's not enough". Even as little as 50 minutes of running once a week has been shown to result in a decrease in the risk of premature death. Higher levels of running do not necessarily improve the mortality benefits.</p>
