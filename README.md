   This project is about creating a multi-page website for social good.
   Specifically, it talks about the importance of exercising regularly and staying fit.
   The website contains 3 pages - Home, Take Action and About.
    
   This project was created as part of a virtual, self-paced learning program with a coding club.
    
   I used HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript languages to create the website.
   In addition to customizing the look and feel of the website through colors, images and fonts using CSS, I also used JavaScript to incorporate button actions.
   Specifically to subscribe to a newsletter and dynamically generate some facts about health and fitness.
   
   I used wireframes to come up with the layout of the website.
   Furthermore, the code was written using the Replit IDE.
